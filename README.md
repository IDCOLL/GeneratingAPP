## A generator based on AngularMeteor 
http://www.angular-meteor.com/

I have been playing with Meteor and Angular 2 a lot lately. Some time back I came across AngularMeteor and I simply love it!

This project has the aim of creating a generator for most of mundane tasks which I encounter with the aim of streamlining the Time To Baseline.
If we get it right (or sort of right) we should end up with a tool that allows us to customize and automate a large portion of the life cycle for new projects and new items in AngularMeteor.

Feel free to contribute.

## Current Version
- Can create new collection with all the normal functions generated
- Windows EXE currently used for generation
- Template file based

## Getting Started
- Clone this project - it is a baseline AngularMeteor template
- In the app folder, run the GNRT_AngularMeteor exe
- Enter your singular UpperCamelCase model name
- The rest of the casing options should auto populate, change any of them as you please.
- Click Generate
- Your files will now be generated
- Run meteor as per norm in the console to start your app

## Road Map
- Error handling
- Add attribute generation
- Add relationship management
- Add support for api integrations
- Add Yeoman version
- Create Visual Studio plugin version
